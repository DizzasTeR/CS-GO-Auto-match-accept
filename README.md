# CS-GO-Auto-match-accept
Accepts competitive match prompt automatically

# Notes
* You need to have python installed to run this
* Game should be focused
* If you use any other resolution than 1024x768 (stretched), the script will try to resize the original image and create a custom one based on your game's resolution
* Initially see if it works for you on your own resolution, if it doesn't perhaps open an issue
